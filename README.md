# SQL Type Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common SQL error caused by a type mismatch in the WHERE clause of a query.  The `bug.sql` file contains a query that incorrectly compares a string value to an integer value, leading to unexpected results.  The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version of the query.
